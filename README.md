# MINT
MINT stands for "the Map Is Not the Territory" by Korzybski.

> Polish-American scientist and philosopher Alfred Korzybski remarked that "the map is not the territory" and that "the word is not the thing", encapsulating his view that an abstraction derived from something, or a reaction to it, is not the thing itself. Korzybski held that many people do confuse maps with territories, that is, confuse models of reality with reality itself. â€” [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation)
